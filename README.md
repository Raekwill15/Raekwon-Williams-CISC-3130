Raekwon Williams CISC 3130 HW2

Notes
  - I used 4 of the spotify csv files and had to make 4 different output files for each list after sorting them 
  - The fifth file "PlaylistandHistory" is the output file to show I made a playlist and a Song History class 
  - I couldnt figure out how to make it so that you can read a number of files automatically without calling methods over and over
    so I had to repeat methods in main alot of times
  - The queue class works but I didn't see the point in having it other than to show that we can make and use one so I made one
    for each week but didn't really use it to help with the other tasks
